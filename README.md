# dog project
Current location of dog project code
This project is based on the Nova Spot micro by Chris Locke. 
The goal of this project is to create a cost-effective and simplistic way to implement this project into reality. 
Our design allows anyone to pair the CAD files from the Nova SM3 project with a simple Arduino and servos to create a fully functional walking dog robot.
